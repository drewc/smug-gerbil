#+TITLE: Super Monadic Ãœber Go-into : Parsers and Gerbil Scheme
  
I discovered monads after writing a parser for org-mode and thinking there must
be a better way. 


It will have wonderful documentation at some point, once the Org Parser is
complete so I know it quite well. For now, how a look at [[https://github.com/drewc/gerborg/blob/master/syntax.org][syntax.org]] in that
project.


  #+begin_src gerbil
    (def (HEADLINE (min-depth 1))
      (.let* ((s (STARS min-depth)) (k TODO-KEYWORD) (p PRIORITY)
              (c COMMENT)
              (title TITLE) (tags (.or (.begin0 TAGS (skip WS) EOL)
                                       (.begin EOL #f))))
        ['headline (list stars: s todo-keyword: k priority: p
                         title: (list->string title) tags: tags
                         commented?2: c footnote-section?: (footnote-section? title)
                         archived?: (archived? tags))]))
  #+end_src
